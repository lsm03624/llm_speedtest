## Introduction

This project is a powerful local large language model (LLM) inference performance testing tool designed to help users quickly and conveniently test the Prefill (prompt processing) and Decode (token generation/output) performance of various locally deployed LLM inference services.

**Two versions available:**
- **Browser Version** (v3 Latest): Runs directly in browser with no backend deployment needed. It now supports Supabase cloud connection to upload test results to the global leaderboard, generates shareable records, and allows batch CSV uploading natively.
- **Python Backend Version** (v3): Uses Python backend to send requests, breaking through browser's 6-connection limit, supporting true high concurrency testing (50+ concurrent) while also supporting complete cloud leaderboards.

This tool is a modified version based on the original work by "Zhiyuan Suifeng" (Bilibili/DeepSeek-R1-0528), adding practical features and optimizations including retry mechanism, automatic chart display, Prefill/Decode speed separation, concurrency fixes, request timeout control, auto-save configuration, concurrent throughput fixes, and token source tracking.

## Core Concepts

*   **OpenAI Compatible API**: Refers to LLM inference APIs that conform to the OpenAI `v1/chat/completions` standard. This tool measures Prefill speed by sending `stream=true` requests and calculating the time until the first token arrives, and Decode speed by calculating the total output completion time.
*   **Ollama API**: Refers to the `api/chat` interface provided by Ollama. This tool sends `stream=false` requests and directly uses metrics like `prompt_eval_duration` and `eval_duration` returned in the Ollama response to calculate performance.
*   **Prefill Throughput**: Measures the speed at which the model processes the input prompt, typically in **tokens/second**. For streaming output, this is calculated from the start of the request until the first token arrives.
*   **Decode Throughput**: Measures the speed at which the model generates output tokens, typically in **tokens/second**. For streaming output, this is calculated from the arrival of the first token until all output is complete.

## Configuration Details

Here are detailed explanations for each configuration item:

*   **API Address (`apiUrl`)**:
    *   **OpenAI Compatible**: E.g., `http://192.168.1.100:8000/v1/chat/completions`. Ensure your LLM inference framework (e.g., vLLM, TGI) is running in OpenAI API compatible mode.
    *   **Ollama**: E.g., `http://localhost:11434/api/chat`. Ensure the Ollama service is running.
*   **Model Name (`modelName`)**:
    *   **OpenAI Compatible**: The model ID or name used by your service, e.g., `qwen-7b-chat`, `mistral-7b-instruct`.
    *   **Ollama**: The model name you pulled in Ollama, e.g., `llama2`, `qwen`.
*   **API-Key (`apiKey`)**: If your LLM service requires API Key authentication, enter it here. Otherwise, it can be left blank.
*   **Notes (`notes`)**: Used to record environment information for each test, e.g., `GeForce RTX 4090, vLLM 0.3.0, Qwen-7B-Chat-AWQ`.
*   **Minimum/Maximum Prompt Length (`minLength`, `maxLength`)**: Defines the token length range for the test prompts.
*   **Step (`step`)**: The amount by which the prompt length increases in each test. For example, `minLength=128, maxLength=1024, step=128` will test prompts of 128, 256, 384...1024 tokens.
*   **Expected Output Length (`outputLength`)**: The number of tokens the model is expected to generate for each request.
*   **Concurrency (`concurrency`)**: The number of requests sent simultaneously. For example, setting it to `4` means that for each prompt length, `4` requests will be made concurrently, and their average performance and total throughput will be calculated.
*   **Request Timeout (ms) (`timeout`)**: The maximum waiting time (in milliseconds) for a single request. If the model fails to complete the response within this time, the request will be considered failed.
*   **Temperature (`temperatureInput`)**: Controls the randomness of model output. Higher values lead to more random output.
*   **Top P (`topPInput`)**: Controls the range of vocabulary the model selects from high to low probability. For example, `0.9` means the model will select vocabulary with a cumulative probability of up to 90%.
*   **Presence Penalty (`presencePenaltyInput`) / Frequency Penalty (`frequencyPenaltyInput`)**: Used to reduce repetition. Presence Penalty penalizes tokens that have already appeared, while Frequency Penalty penalizes frequently appearing tokens. Ollama API typically combines these into `repeat_penalty`.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Test long-time unresponsive/failure**:
    *   Check if the `API Address` is correct and the network is reachable.
    *   Check if the `Model Name` matches the server configuration.
    *   Check if the `API-Key` is correct.
    *   Increase `Request Timeout (ms)`.
    *   For OpenAI compatible APIs, ensure your service supports streaming (`stream: true`) responses.
*   **Ollama API test fails with missing `duration` field**:
    *   Ensure your Ollama service is a newer version and returns the necessary performance metrics.
*   **Charts not displayed or data anomalous**:
    *   Check the browser console (F12) for error messages.
    *   Clear browser cache and retry.
*   **High concurrency test results vary greatly**:
    *   Ensure your hardware resources (GPU VRAM, CPU threads) can support high concurrency.
    *   Other background loads might interfere with test results.
    *   Model service configurations (e.g., maximum batch size) might affect performance under high concurrency.
*   **CSV import charts not displaying data or showing errors**:
    *   Ensure the imported CSV file is in the standard format exported by this tool.
    *   Check if the column names in the CSV file match the expected names (e.g., "Prompt Length (tokens)", "Prefill Speed (tokens/s)", "Output Speed (tokens/s)").
